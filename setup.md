# Overview

This course is designed to be run on pre-configured Amazon Web Services Machine Images (AMIs), one AMI for each participant. If you are signed up to take the course, you do **not** need to worry about setting up an AMI instance. The Cloud-SPAN team will create an instance that will be provided to you at no cost. Prior to the course you will receive instructions by email to connect to your AMI instance at the coursse.

All of the software and data used in the course are hosted on each AMI with the exception of three software tools: a **spreadsheet**, the **Integrative Genomics Viewer** (IGV), and, for Windows users only, **Git Bash**. You *do not* need to install a spreadsheet program or IGV in your laptop or desktop, as we will be using online versions of both through the browser. Please ensure you have an updated browser installed in the laptop or desktop you will be using. **Tablets** and **iPads** are **not suitable** for the course.  

## Required additional software to install in your personal computer

Only participants that will use a Windows laptop or desktop, must install **Git Bash** before the course as instructed below. Git Bash is a command-line interface (CLI), also known as the **shell** and a **terminal**, which will allow you to access your AMI from your personal computer.

Participants using a Linux or Mac OS X computer will only need to open a Terminal running the Bash shell. 

> ## Installing Git Bash on Windows
> - Download the [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) which installs both Git and Git Bash. 
> - Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and follow the next steps.
> - Click on "Next" four times (two times if you've previously installed Git). You don't need to change anything in the screens Information, Location, Components, and Start Menu.
> - Select "Use the nano editor by default" and click on "Next". You may need to scroll up to see this option.
> - Click on "Next".
> - Keep "Use Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" selected and click on "Next". If you forgot to do this, programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
> - Click on "Next" two times.
> - Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".
> - Select "Use Windows' default console window" and click on "Next".
> - Click on "Next" three times.
> - Click on "Install".
> - Click on "Finish".
